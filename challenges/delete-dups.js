/**
 * Write a function deleteDups that removes duplicates from an unsorted linked list.
 *
 * Example:
 * 1->2->3->3
 *
 * deleteDups(head); -> 1->2->3
 *
 * Extra:
 * How would you solve this problem if a temporary buffer is not allowed?
 */


//  my notes
  // with using a temporary buffer
    // you would create an object that has values and if the number already exists you would remove that node
  // without using a temporary buffer
    // maybe you would sort the linked list
    // and then remove duplicates while traversing through the sort

// good example 1->2->2->1->5
function deleteDups(head) {

}

module.exports = deleteDups;
